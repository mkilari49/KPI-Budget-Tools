            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
                These measures demonstrate an ideal, yet realistically inspired, depiction of an IT support team making
                steady
                progress. The stability in growth of customer satisfaction, first contact resolution (FCR), and system
                uptime are
                all direct outcomes of formal support processes and well-defined escalation strategies (Singh, 2025).
                The
                incorporation of tiered escalation flowcharts enabled the team to address problems more effectively,
                routing them
                to Tier 2 or Tier 3 support only in exceptionally complicated cases. This decrease in turnaround time
                and
                structured communication contributed significantly to improved service outcomes and end-user
                satisfaction.

                In this budget plan, the focus is on the practical allocation of $965 across critical IT support areas
                to enhance performance and professional development.
                Investment in Jira supports automation and SLA tracking. Udemy courses empower the team with network and
                scripting skills.
                The wireless access point upgrade improves reliability and reduces downtime in busy conference zones
                (Lorincz et al., 2023).
                The ITIL Foundation exam prepares Tier 2 technicians for structured service delivery. Ergonomic
                accessories like headsets and mice contribute to clearer communication and better support quality.

            <p><strong>To:</strong> Director of IT Operations<br>
                <strong>From:</strong> Mohith Kumar Kilari, IT Support Supervisor<br>
                <strong>Date:</strong> July 6, 2025<br>
                <strong>Subject:</strong> Monthly Team KPI Summary & Budget Allocation Report
            </p>

            <p>
                Over the last month, the IT support team has achieved notable progress in key performance indicators.
                Since we were more responsive and followed through, our Customer Satisfaction Score improved from 84% to
                90%, meeting our target.
                First Contact Resolution has marked a 15% increase and now stands at 78%, thanks to active training
                sessions and improved ticket triaging protocols.
                Hardware upgrades and early signal diagnostics contributed to a system uptime of 99.9%, surpassing our
                goal. The team's structured workflow and enhanced communication have been instrumental in these
                outcomes.
