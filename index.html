      <h2>Customer Service Standards Statement</h2>
      <p>
        As an IT Supervisor, I believe every end-user deserves to be treated with patience, empathy, and respect.
        Technology should empower users, not frustrate them, and my goal is to make IT a positive, enabling
        experience.<br><br>

        <strong>How IT Should Treat End Users:</strong><br>
        - With respect and clear communication<br>
        - By listening actively and validating concerns<br>
        - Providing timely, accurate solutions without blame<br><br>

        <strong>Great Service Means:</strong><br>
        - Fast, friendly, and reliable assistance<br>
        - Proactive rather than reactive support<br>
        - Consistent follow-up<br><br>

        <strong>Complaint Resolution:</strong><br>
        - Stay calm and composed<br>
        - Apologize sincerely<br>
        - Investigate thoroughly<br>
        - Communicate timelines<br>
        - Follow up to confirm resolution

      <h2>Escalation Flowchart</h2>
      <p>
        The escalation flowchart outlines the structured process followed when a customer service or technical issue
        cannot be resolved at the first level of support. It defines escalation tiers and communication channels to
        ensure timely and effective resolution.

        <strong>Subject:</strong> Re: Wi-Fi Connectivity Issue in Conference Room<br><br>
        Dear [User],<br><br>
        Thank you for bringing the Wi-Fi issues in the conference room to our attention. I entirely agree with you that
        a bad internet connection is highly frustrating, especially when you are in the middle of an important meeting
        or working on a group project. Your patience in this matter is greatly appreciated as we work to resolve this
        issue.<br><br>
        After running one of our diagnostic checks, we found out that the access point nearby was dropping the signal,
        which is an indication that this could be part of the problem. At this stage, we are resetting the router and
        recalibrating the range to serve the zone more or less affected. Connecting the support and other components of
        the network through technical means will often increase productivity (Mendieta, 2021).<br><br>
        In the meantime, I recommend using the guest network, which is more stable. If the connection does not improve,
        we will escalate the issue to involve our engineering team for further diagnostics and investigation. I hope
        this helps, and I will provide a further update within 45 minutes.<br><br>
        Kind regards,<br>
        <strong>Mohith Kumar Kilari</strong><br>
